# Coursera_bike_sharing_case_study
This repository is created to show my work during the final phase of Google Data Analytics Certificate - Capstone: Complete a Case Study.
As part of my Google Data Analytics Certification, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Cyclisticâ€™s bike-share data to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently.
Using BigQuery for SQL-based analysis, I explored ride duration trends, peak usage times, and station popularity.
My findings showed that casual riders take longer rides, prefer weekends, and use bikes near tourist areas, while members ride frequently for shorter durations, likely for commuting.
Based on these insights, I developed three key business recommendations: launching a Weekend Warrior membership plan, targeted promotions at high-traffic stations, and incentives for long rides.
This case study demonstrates my ability to analyze large datasets, extract meaningful insights, and translate findings into business strategies.
